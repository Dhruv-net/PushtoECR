# Docker Image Build and Push Automation

This project demonstrates the setup and automation of building Docker images and pushing them to a private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using AWS services.

## Overview

The project utilizes AWS CodeCommit for version control, AWS CodeBuild for building Docker images, and Amazon ECR for hosting private container images.

## Setup

### 1. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

- Create a private ECR repository in the AWS Management Console.
- Make a note of the repository URI for later use.

### 2. AWS CodeCommit Repository

- Create a new AWS CodeCommit repository to host your Docker project.
- Clone the repository locally to start working with your Dockerfile and related files.

### 3. Dockerfile

- Craft a Dockerfile in your CodeCommit repository according to your project's requirements.
- Ensure the Dockerfile is configured to build your application into a Docker image.

### 4. AWS CodeBuild Project

- Set up an AWS CodeBuild project to automate the Docker image building process.
- Configure the project to pull the Dockerfile from your CodeCommit repository.
- Utilize a `buildspec.yml` file to define the build steps, including building and pushing the Docker image to the ECR repository.

### 5. `buildspec.yml`

- Create a `buildspec.yml` file in the root of your CodeCommit repository.
- Define the build steps in the `buildspec.yml`, including:
  - Logging in to Amazon ECR.
  - Building the Docker image.
  - Pushing the Docker image to the ECR repository.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the automated pipeline to build and push Docker images to your private ECR repository:

1. Make changes to your Docker project and commit them to your CodeCommit repository.
2. AWS CodeBuild will automatically trigger a build process based on your `buildspec.yml`.
3. The Docker image will be built and pushed to your private ECR repository.

## Notes

- Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions are set up for accessing ECR, CodeCommit, and CodeBuild resources.
- Regularly monitor your ECR repository for image updates and vulnerabilities.
- Update your Dockerfile and build process as needed to maintain the security and efficiency of your Docker images.

## Conclusion

By following this setup, you have established a streamlined process for managing Docker images using AWS services, enabling efficient development, version control, and deployment of containerized applications within your AWS infrastructure.
